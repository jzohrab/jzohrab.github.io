Lute v3 is getting very very close to good to launch, if it's not already.

<!--end_excerpt-->

Right now Lute v3 is on beta round 11 -- all the betas have been stable, with one or two small bugs.

* [Lute3 on Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/lute3/)
* [Lute3 on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jzohrab/lute3/general)
* [Lute manual](https://jzohrab.github.io/lute-manual/intro.html)

Everything has mostly worked as expected, with some clarifying tweaks.

I'm still concerned about long-term viability, just because I'm still the only one working on it.  But it is still too early to say what the dev community uptake will be.

I'll be officially cutting over to 3.0.0 this week -- either Nov 21 or 22.  Users won't notice at all, but that's fine.  The official thing will be the same as 3.0.0bXX.
