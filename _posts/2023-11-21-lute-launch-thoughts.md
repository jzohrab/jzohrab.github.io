Lute v3 launched today.  Wow, that was a lot of work, so nice to have it done.

Everything seems to be in order.  Some final bugs and tweaks, several test runs.  Release process updated.  New pip and docker stuff pushed.  Manual updated.  User communication done.

I wonder if this thing will take off as much as I think it should.  Guess it's time to hurry up and wait.

In the meantime, I deserve a break.
