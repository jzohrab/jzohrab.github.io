Lute v3 has been going great!  Users seem to like it, the install is _so_ much easier than it was, and some people have made some great contributions, notably an audio player.

All in all, very happy with how things are going.

There is a ton of stuff to do.  I'm trying a [GitHub project](https://github.com/users/jzohrab/projects/1) to track issues, size, and priority.  The biggest things on my mind: using spaCy or NLTK for parsing, and Anki exports, though there are others.

The long-term issue remains, which is how to ensure that the project lives on past me, and stays healthy.  The current code isn't bad, though of course everything can always be improved.  I'm not really sure how to make it even better for contribution, other than more documentation.
