title:  Lute v3 porting milestone
categories: lute
---

Lots of progress after lots of hacking.  Just one test remaining, and everything seems fine.  Still a handful of tasks before I can consider the initial port complete.  Phew.  I feel that v3 is a significant step in the right direction: the code is clearer, there's less of it, and it's faster.

<!--end_excerpt-->

## What's done

User facing stuff: Pretty much everything appears to be working -- start up, creating books, reading, defining terms.

Back end: db and demo management, unit tests, acceptance tests.

Test porting:

```
$ composer dev:portstats
tests/acceptance/NoMecab_Test.php:    public function test_no_mecab_should_still_be_ok(): void  // V3-port: TODO
--------------------------------
> composer dev:find V3-port | grep DONE | wc -l
     287
> composer dev:find V3-port | grep TODO | grep -v README | wc -l
       1
```

## Comparisons

* Python code line count is smaller: about 75% of the PHP project total line count for both tests and source.
* Acceptance test speed: v3 acceptance tests are, guessing, about 10x faster than v2.
* Python/Flask code is much nicer to read than PHP/Symfony.
* Architecturally, I feel it's way better: things are more-or-less grouped according to function.

## What's left

It's a medium-sized list of important things

* user settings
* code to-do comments  (`inv todos` returns a few, ignore the `zzfuture fix` ones)
* versioning w/ toml file
* packaging
* test installation through pip
* ToDesktop (?)
* ... other stuff

The biggest things are the versioning and packaging.

And then I'll need to dogfood it.
