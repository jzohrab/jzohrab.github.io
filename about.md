Hi there.  I'm a retired software dev, but still look to make contributions back to the world.

My current main project is [Lute](./lute), free software that you install on your machine to learn foreign languages by reading.

I play guitar, and wrote a small free book about [practicing guitar](https://practicing-guitar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a collection of techniques collected from other teachers, books, and websites.
