Hi there.  I'm a retired software dev, but still look to make contributions back to the world.

My current main project is [Lute](/lute), free software that you install on your machine to learn foreign languages by reading.

I also play guitar, and sometimes write and make videos about playing and practicing.  See [stuff here](/guitar).

Cheers! jz
